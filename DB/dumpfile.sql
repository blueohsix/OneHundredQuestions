INSERT INTO `questions` VALUES (1,'How many kids do you want?','I want 1 or 3 children ','1-3 children is best. If more children happen, or if no-children happen: life is still okay. If we are unable to have children, I would like to adopt a child. My parents had five children and I think that is a lot of life to manage. '),(2,'What values do you want to install in your children?','I want to teach them to be honest, kind, truthful and respectful to people, know the value of family and the simple things in life.','Primarily, I want them to appreciate ideas, experiences, and relationships more than objects, fads, or the pursuit of wealth. I want them to know that trust is the foundation of every relationship. I want them to know that their parents are mentors, their safety net. \nTwo life-lessons I wish I learned when I was a child: \n1) hate the man’s demons and not the man. What this means is that it is okay to be frustrated with certain aspects of a person, but that those aspects are not the person. Don’t hate the person, hate the bad behaviors. \n2) Everybody has their own story. Everybody’s story is made of different experiences. A person’s experiences determine how they behave and how they think. Before critiquing another person, try to understand the environment they were raised in. Remember that you behave and think   in ways that reflect your experiences and upbringing.  This applies to politics, religion, and social behaviors. \n\nI know these lessons now, but continue to struggle to implement them. These lessons are what I want to pass to our children and I hope they will implement the lessons better than I do. '),(3,'How do you want to discipline your kids?','I believe that conversation and trust are the basis of a healthy relationship, I want our children to have confidence so that they are comfortable telling us everything.  Based on a healthy relationship we can guide, advise and be firm when needed. ','Discipline is needed when our children are behaving in a way that is not acceptable for the environment. We are their mentors and guides for their first several years and it is our job to raise them in the best way we know so that they become productive, caring, and respectful adults. I will need to research corrective actions for children, because I don’t like the idea of striking them, or “spanking”. I’m sure there are other effective methods for guiding children away from unintentionally self-destructive behaviors, but I am not sure what they are yet. '),(4,'What would you do if one of your children said he was homosexual?','I definitely don\'t know what my first reaction would be.\n Maybe scared, nervous, frustrated, or maybe I\'m not taken aback by already knowing.\n But regardless, when things calm down, I will continue to love, care and support!  I\'m not a mom yet, but I\'m sure my love will be bigger than just a sexual option.','Sexual orientation isn’t a problem, but I do believe that a homosexual person who develops flamboyant behaviors will struggle in being respected by the public. It is their choice in who they marry and love and the lifestyle is not as dangerous as it used to be. My mother’s brother is homosexual and married another man. They live in Chicago and visit a few times every year. I think the most important thing that I hope to impress upon a homosexual child is that they shouldn’t rebel for the sake of making others uncomfortable. Sure, we can all say that we want the world to accept us for who we are, but being obnoxious and telling others to respect us is different from being respectful to others. You will receive a lot more respect by being respectful rather than demanding respect. '),(5,'What if our children didn\'t want to go to college?','I would try to understand his reasons for not wanting to go to college and try with you and him to find the best way.\n I would encourage him to take a vocational course, to specialize in some area, there are other ways to achieve professional success without a college.\n I do not want to transfer dreams or create expectations upon our children.','^ Karol’s answer is perfect and mirrors my thoughts exactly. '),(6,'How much say do children have in a family?','I believe we should always listen to children, they also have feelings, wills and this is very good, with limits and a lot of respect, we are the adults and most of the time we know what is better or not.\n I think this should be good!  Listening to our children\'s opinions, we both talk and decide what will be done.\n When our children grow up and mature, we can decide together in a smart and healthy way.','Children have a lot of direct influence in what happens in a family. Their behavior and interests affect the family rhythm significantly. That doesn’t mean that children drive the family, because parents choose the values and basic ideological framework of the family, but parents should pay attention to the wants and needs of their children so that they can help shape a healthy life trajectory for that child. Don’t force a child to be something they done’t want to be. Be flexible, nurture their interests, discourage self-destructive behaviors. '),(7,'How comfortable are you around children?','I think an educated, kind and boundary child makes people want to be around.\n I feel like children like this, and I hope we can raise our children like that, with lots of love but with limits too.','It depends a lot on the temperament of the child! I am not comfortable if the child is obnoxious, ill-behaved, rude, etc.\nThere are some children I enjoy being around! These children are curious, respectful, and insightful. I hope to raise children who demonstrate these positive qualities and have a desire to improve their lives and the lives of the people around them. '),(8,'Would you be opposed to having our parents watch the children so we can spend time alone together?','I would like!  It would be good for us to have some time together and be good for their relationship','I’d be happy for our parents to watch our children for a short while so that we can be alone together! =) '),(9,'Would you put your children in private or public school?','If the school were really good and we could afford to keep the cost of tuition, we would talk and see if it\'s worth it, but if not, we would look for a good public school.','I do not think the benefits of a private school outweigh the financial cost of private school tuition. I think we will find a good public school district  to live in and our children will go to the school nearest to our home. '),(10,'What are your thoughts on home schooling?','\nEu não tenho todo o conhecimento necessário para lecionar, eu acho que estudar em casa não substitui a experiência de estar em uma escola. \nAlém das matérias da grade escolar que é muito importante, as crianças aprendem a se relacionar com outras crianças, aprende a dividir, a observar.. enfim, eu acho que ensinar em casa não substitui o ensinamento de uma escola.','There is one advantage and several disadvantages to home schooling. The advantage is that parents have full control of the curriculum and  child’s exposure to the world. This is useful to prevent the child from discovering self-destructive behaviors. \nThe disadvantages might outweigh the advantage: lack of socialization, learning that there is a world full of other people out there, learning how to interact with a diverse array of individuals, and learning to cope with unexpected situations. Life is full of unexpected good things and unexpected bad things, and schooling at home shelters children from those events. A child schooled at home has less experiences to learn from and will be socially less developed and less independent than a child raised in a more public environment. '),(11,'Would you be willing to adopt if we couldn\'t have kids?','\nCom toda certeza! É óbvio que se eu puder escolher teremos um filho que seja formado em meu ventre, eu quero poder sentir todas as sensações de ter um ser crescendo dentro de mim através do nosso amor. \nPorém, se tratando de amor, eu acredito facilmente que eu poderia amar um filho que não tivesse sido gerado pelo meu corpo.\nÉ amor do mesmo jeito! \nProvavelmente na maior parte do tempo eu nem lembraria que é adotado. O amor faria isso!\nEntão sim, caso não possamos ter filhos que seja formado em meu corpo, para mim essa seria uma opção.','Yep! '),(12,'Would you be willing to seek medical treatment if we couldn\'t have kids naturally?','Of course!','Yep!'),(13,'Do you believe it\'s OK to discipline your child in public?','It depends!  If they are doing something they NEED to discipline right now, maybe take them to a bathroom, somewhere discreet, talk as quietly as possible.\n But if it is something that we can \'discipline\' with our eyes, we will do it and talk at home.','This is a delicate issue... Parents need to be careful with how their discipline is perceived by the public. If anybody views the discipline as \'abuse\', it is very easy for the state to become involved and investigate \"child abuse\".  A child should always understand why they are being disciplined, otherwise the child becomes confused and the problematic behavior will arise again in the future. Public discipline should never be physically harsh. The maximum is probably a slap on the wrist and/or a quiet, stern conversation. The punishment/correction must suit the offense and it should be respectful to the child and respectful to people observing.'),(14,'How do you feel about paying for your kid\'s college education?','Normal, it’s okay for me ','College/University education is very, very expensive in the United States, but there are ways for it to be affordable. If a child does well in school, there are often scholarship programs, stipends, and government grants available to them that pays for university. Some employers will pay for an employee’s school. If an individual joins the military, their future education opportunities will be guaranteed (with risks attached). \nThe way I view this issue: A child is responsible for securing the funding opportunity for their higher education. They should apply themselves fully to their academics and their parents should offer their financial support to the child when they need it. \nMaybe someday higher education in the United States will become fully paid for via taxes and it won\'t cost a small fortune. '),(15,'How far apart do you want kids?','2 ~ 3 years ','2+ years, I think is a good gap between children. This allows for one child to attain a degree of autonomy while their sibling develops. But if we have twins, it isn’t a problem. We will just doing double the work! Haha'),(16,'Would you want someone to stay home with the kids or use day care?','I want to take care of you, the house and our children.\n That is my planning, taking care of our family.\n But if there was a need to work out and someone take care of our children yes, it would be difficult! But sometimes we have no choice.','I think Karol is planning to stay home with our children while I am at an office. I am “old-fashioned” when it comes to the idea of a nuclear family  and I feel that it is a good model. I am very fortunate to have Karol because it is increasingly rare that somebody desires to be a housewife! She is amazing. '),(17,'How would you feel if our kids wanted to join the military rather than go to college?','I want us to be the foundation for our children to make the best choices for their lives.\n And then they will decide what is best for themselves and we will remain confident in the education we have given them.','The United States military offers a lot of benefits for its members, but there risks associated with it. Our children will need to decide for themselves if their morals will allow them to join. The morality of the United States’ foreign policy and the way the military functions can be a matter of mental anguish if you disagree with them. Imagine working for an employer, but disliking the business and your boss. \nThe military positioned me for a good life! There are many benefits that most countries give their citizens, but Americans only have access to these same benefits if they or their spouse  spent time in the military. '),(18,'How involved do you want grandparents to be in our parenting?','',''),(19,'How will we handle parental decisions?','',''),(20,'Would you be willing to go to marriage counseling if we were having marital problems?','',''),(21,'If there is a disagreement between me and your family, whose side do you choose?','',''),(22,'How do you handle disagreements?','',''),(23,'Would you ever consider divorce?','',''),(24,'Would you rather discuss issues as they arise or wait until you have a few problems?','',''),(25,'How would you communicate you aren\'t satisfied sexually?','',''),(26,'What is the best way to handle disagreements in a marriage?','',''),(27,'How can I be better at communicating with you?','',''),(28,'What are your views on infidelity?','',''),(29,'What are your religious views on marriage?','',''),(30,'What\'s more important, work or family?','',''),(31,'What are your political views?','',''),(32,'What are your views on birth control?','',''),(33,'Would you rather be rich and miserable or poor and happy?','',''),(34,'Who will make the biggest decisions of the household?','',''),(35,'What would you do if someone said something bad about me?','',''),(36,'Would you follow the advice of your family before your spouse?','',''),(37,'What do you believe the role of a wife is?','',''),(38,'Who should do household chores?','',''),(39,'What do you believe the role of a husband is?','',''),(40,'How do you feel about debt?','',''),(41,'Would you share all money with your spouse or split the money into different accounts?','',''),(42,'What are your views on saving money?','',''),(43,'What are your views on spending money?','',''),(44,'What if we both want something but can\'t afford both?','',''),(45,'How well do you budget?','',''),(46,'Do you feel it is important to save for retirement?','',''),(47,'Would you be willing to get a second job if we had financial problems?','',''),(48,'Do you have any debt?','',''),(49,'What if a family member wants to borrow a large sum of money?','',''),(50,'Who will take care of the financial matters of the household?','',''),(51,'Do you enjoy traveling?','',''),(52,'How often would you like to travel?','',''),(53,'Where would you like to travel?','',''),(54,'How important is spending time alone to you?','',''),(55,'How would you feel about me going on a trip with the girls (boys) for a couple of weeks?','',''),(56,'How important is spending time with friends to you?','',''),(57,'What would be the perfect weekday evening to you?','',''),(58,'What would we do if we both had a break from work, but each of us had different ideas on how to spend it?','',''),(59,'How often would you want to visit your family?','',''),(60,'How often will your family visit us?','',''),(61,'How often would you want my family to visit?','',''),(62,'How often would you want to visit my family?','',''),(63,'Do you have a family history of diseases or genetic abnormalities?','',''),(64,'What if one of your family members said he disliked me?','',''),(65,'How would you handle holiday family visits?','',''),(66,'If your parents became ill, would you take them in?','',''),(67,'If my parents became ill, would you mind taking them in?','',''),(68,'Does anyone in your family suffer from alcoholism?','',''),(69,'What is your medical family history?','',''),(70,'Would you be opposed to mental health treatment?','',''),(71,'If I had to change my diet because of medical concerns, would you be willing to change yours?','',''),(72,'Are you willing to exercise with me to improve our health?','',''),(73,'Where do you want to live?','',''),(74,'Would you mind moving if I had to relocate with my job?','',''),(75,'What would you do if we fell out of love?','',''),(76,'What are your career aspirations?','',''),(77,'What would you like to be doing five or ten years from now?','',''),(78,'What do you think is the best way to keep the love alive in a marriage?','',''),(79,'How do you think life will change if we got married?','',''),(80,'What is the best thing about marriage?','',''),(81,'What is the worst thing about marriage?','',''),(82,'What is your idea of the best weekend?','',''),(83,'How important are wedding anniversaries to you?','',''),(84,'How would you like to spend special days?','',''),(85,'What kind of grandparent do you want to be someday?','',''),(86,'What type of house do you want to live in?','',''),(87,'What is your biggest fear about marriage?','',''),(88,'What excites you about getting married?','',''),(89,'What do wedding rings mean to you?','',''),(90,'Are you afraid to talk to me about anything?','',''),(91,'What do you think would improve our relationship?','',''),(92,'What would be one thing you would change about our relationship?','',''),(93,'Do you have any doubts about the future of our relationship?','',''),(94,'Do you believe love can pull you through anything?','',''),(95,'Is there anything you don\'t trust about me?','',''),(96,'Which would you choose -
