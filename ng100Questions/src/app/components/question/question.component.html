          <blockquote>
            “Love is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake and then
            subsides. And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have
            to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that
            it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what
            love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not
            the promulgation of promises of eternal passion. That is just being
            "in love" which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself
            is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is
            both an art and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it, we
            had roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the
            pretty blossoms had fallen from our branches we found that we were
            one tree and not two.”<br /><br />
